 <strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#326698">Searching for Newsgroups: </font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">The
        Direct Read News newsgroup search enables you to quickly locate a specific newsgroup on
        the news server, or a list of newsgroups based on your search phrase. Once you've
        found a newsgroup or a list of groups, you can use your web browser's "bookmark"
        feature to tag your favorite discussion forums for quick access in the future.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">        A search may be
        as simple as inputting a single newsgroup name like &quot;news.announce.newusers&quot;,
        which would take you directly to the &quot;news.announce.newusers&quot;&nbsp;newsgroup
        through the Direct Read News web interface, or it could be a compound
        search that would locate a collection of groups based on a string of
        keywords and special&nbsp;characters that you might put together...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">              comp.systems.*|alt.fan.*|^news.admin.&amp;|*.sport*|rec.boat*|*.jobs.*</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/greendot.gif" width="10" height="9">  
 <strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#326698">Search Characters: </font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">        The Newsgroup Search engine will accept a variety of
special characters, which
        will aid you in finding a broad or specific collection of newsgroups, based on the way
        you couple the these characters with keywords in the search field. These
        characters are described in further detail below:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>&quot;*&quot;</b> - The
    asterisk symbol is a wild card search character. As an example, <i>*.sports.*</i><b>
    </b>would find newsgroups that have the word sports in their newsgroup
    title, <i>sports.*</i><b> </b>would find all groups that start with the word
    sports, and <i>*.sports</i> would find all groups that end with the word
    sports.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>&quot;|&quot;</b> - The
    pipe symbol is used to join multiple searches. As an example <i>sports.*|*.sports</i>
    would list all groups that started with the word sports or ended with the
    word sports. It could also be used to search related newsgroups that might
    appear in different Usenet hierarchies, such as <i>alt.sports.*|rec.sports.*</i>
    which would find all newsgroups in the &quot;alt&quot; (Alternative) or
    &quot;rec&quot; (Recreation) hierarchies that utilized the word sports in
    their group titles.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>&quot;&amp;&quot;</b> - The
    ampersand symbol is a limiting character, meaning a search will only yield
    groups with one word beyond the &quot;&amp;&quot; symbol. As an example, <i>comp.&amp;</i>
    would retrieve a newsgroup title like &quot;comp.ai&quot; which only had two
    words in its title, while a group like &quot;comp.ai.alife&quot; would not
    be retrieved in this example because the title contains more than two total
    words.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000"><b>&quot;^&quot;</b> - This
    symbol is another limiting character, meaning the search will only detect
    newsgroup titles with no other characters to the left of the &quot;^&quot;
    symbol. As an example <i>^rec</i> would pick up all newsgroups starting with
    the word &quot;rec&quot;, but would ignore a newsgroup like &quot;alt.recreation&quot;
    because it does not begin with the word &quot;rec&quot; in this example.</font></li>
