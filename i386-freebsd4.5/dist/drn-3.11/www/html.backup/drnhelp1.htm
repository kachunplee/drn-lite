          of the post tab opens a Direct Read News posting page where new or
          reply messages can be sent to a newsgroup. If you click on the
          &quot;Post Message&quot; tab while you're in the main list of articles
          within a newsgroup, you will post an original message to the group. If
          you have opened a particular article within a newsgroup, and you've
          clicked on the &quot;Post Reply&quot; icon within that message, you
          will make a reply post to that specific message.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#000000">If
          the &quot;Post Message&quot; tab is selected while in a binary
          newsgroup, a slightly different posting form will appear with an
          &quot;Attachment&quot; field that will let you attach a binary file
          along with your post (photo file, sound file, movie file, etc.). In
          the event that you are in a text-only newsgroup, the posting form will
          not include this &quot;Attachment&quot; field.</font></p>

        that would appear when posting to a binary specific newsgroup, and the only difference
        between this form and a text-only posting form would be the appearance of the
        &quot;Attachment&quot; field which would not be present on the text-only posting form.</font></p>

            and in this example, the posted message will go to the &quot;<em>alt.binaries.pictures.autos</em>&quot;
            group. If you wished to post your message to more than one
            newsgroup, you would place a comma (,) directly after the first
            newsgroup title in this field, then followed by the title of the
            next newsgroup. A blank space should not be included after the comma.</font></p>

            This is where you type in the title of your newsgroup message. If you are posting an
            original message to a newsgroup, this will field will be blank and you would simply type
            in the title of your message. In this example, the subject/title of the message is &quot;<em>Here's
            a photo of my '72 Pinto - mypinto.gif (1/1)</em>&quot;. If you are replying to an existing
            message in a newsgroup, this field would display the subject/title of the original
            newsgroup message you are replying to, and an &quot;Re:&quot; would be inserted in front
            of the Subject line to indicate a reply message.</font></p>

            but the posting author could have elected to use another address
            (fake@name.com), a name like (Bob, Robert, etc.), a nickname (Mr. X,
            Bob-o-rama, etc.), or any combination of the above. This can be
            entered in a number of ways such as &quot;<a href="mailto:Bob%20%3cBob@somewhere.com"><i>Bob &lt;Bob@somewhere.com</i></a><i>&gt;</i>&quot;,
            &quot;<a href="mailto:Bob@somewhere.com%20(Bob)"><i>Bob@somewhere.com (Bob)</i></a>&quot;,

            attachments. Simply click the &quot;Browse&quot; button and select a
            file name to attach to your post. If you forget to enter a file name
            within your subject line for the attachment, that information will
            automatically be inserted for you. Additionally, if you post a file
            which exceeds the default number of lines (7500), your file/post
            will automatically be broken into the correct number of lines and
            parts. If, for any reason, your post is not accepted and you get an
            on-screen message telling you to return to the post form to enter
            missing information, etc., please verify the attachment file name is
            still showing in the Attachment box. If it isn't showing, please
            click the Browse button again and re-select the filename.</font></p>
