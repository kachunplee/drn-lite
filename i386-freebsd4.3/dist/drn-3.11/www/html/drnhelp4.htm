        Newsgroup Lists:</font></strong> Usenet newsgroups are generally broken into main
          hierarchies like
        &quot;Alt&quot;, &quot;Comp&quot;, &quot;Rec&quot;, etc., as well as sub hierarchies which
        are a collection of groups that fall under a broad topic like &quot;sports&quot;,
        &quot;music&quot;, &quot;writing&quot;, etc. As an example, &quot;alt.sport.bowling&quot;
        is a specific newsgroup, which falls under the &quot;alt.sport.*&quot; sub hierarchy,
        which in turn falls under the main hierarchy known as &quot;Alt&quot;. By clicking on the
          blue arrow or hierarchy links within Direct Read News...</font><p align="center"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp4a.gif" width="216" height="22"></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">...users can jump from their current newsgroup, to a list
        of similar newsgroups within that sub hierarchy, or back to a larger list of newsgroups
        that fall within a more general main hierarchy. In this example, you may be in the
        &quot;alt.binaries.multimedia.anime&quot; newsgroup, and if you wanted to see a list of other
        multimedia newsgroups within the hierarchy (alt.binaries.multimedia.disney,
        etc.), you
        would click on the &quot;alt.binaries.multimedia.*&quot; hierarchy
        link noted above.</font></font></p>

        <strong> <font color="#326698">Navigating Article Lists:</font></strong> Depending upon the
        popularity of a specific newsgroup, you may enter a group to find that 10 articles, or
        over 10,000+ articles, have been posted there. In the event that you access a newsgroup
        with a large number of articles, Direct Read News will display that list in groups of 50
        to 100 articles at a time. In order to navigate between article pages within a newsgroup,
        you would use the following tool...</font></p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp4b.gif" width="544" height="25"></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The hyperlinked numbers (<u>17</u>.<u>18</u>.<u>19</u>)
        represent the number of article pages within a newsgroup, and you can jump to a specific
        page by simply clicking on one of the numbers that appears between the &quot;Back&quot;
        and &quot;More&quot; buttons. The page you are currently on will appear as a larger font
        than the other page numbers (1 in this example) and should appear as a different color as
        well.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Page numbers are displayed in increments of 20, and you
        would use the &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;More&quot; buttons to retrieve the previous or
        next group of page numbers. As an example, if you were currently viewing pages 31-50, and
        you clicked on the &quot;More&quot; button, you would retrieve the next collection of
        article pages which would be 51-70. If you clicked on the &quot;Back&quot; button instead,
        you would retrieve article pages 11-30. A &quot;Start&quot; button will bring you back
        to first article page within a newsgroup.</font></td>
