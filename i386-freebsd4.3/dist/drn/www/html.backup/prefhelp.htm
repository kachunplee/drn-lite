          <strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#326698">Subscribing to
          Newsgroups:</font></strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">
          </font><font face="Arial" size="2"> By subscribing to a newsgroup, you
          can conveniently keep track of incoming messages within that
          particular group . Three methods of establishing or modifying your personal
          subscribe list are explained below.<br>
          <br>
          <img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefedit.gif" width="206" height="18">
          The first method of subscribing is to view all<br>
             newsgroups available. The first time you view this list, there will be no boxes checked
          indicating there are no subscribed newsgroups. After your subscribe list has been
          established, the list will reflect your current subscribe choices with a check in the box
          beside those groups you have subscribed to. The list is expandable based on
          hierarchies. Those names in bold and ending with an asterisk (*) are hierarchies.&nbsp;</font>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> To view the groups within a hierarchy, simply click the hierarchy name and you will be
          taken to a list of the groups and possible sub-hierarchies within that hierarchy. Group
          names that have a check box next to them are at the actual newsgroup
          level, and when you click on a group name it will take you directly to
          the messages within that newsgroup.&nbsp;</font>
          </p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"> By clicking the box next to a newsgroup name, you are indicating that you wish to subscribe to that
          particular newsgroup. If the box is already checked and you uncheck it, the group will
          be removed from your personal subscribe list once you press the "Save Settings"
          button located at the end of the page. Changes will not be recorded until you
          press the "Save Settings" button at the end of the page.<br>
          <br>
          <img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefview.gif" width="206" height="18"> The second method is to view your current subscribed list.
          This will show you all groups you have previously selected. By unchecking the box
          next to a particular group, you can easily remove it from your active list. Because this
          list represents your personal choices, it is an excellent start page for your browser or
          should be bookmarked for convenient access. Don't forget to press the "Save
          Settings" button at the end of the page for your changes to take effect.<br>
          <br>
          <img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefsearch.gif" width="206" height="18"> The final method is to use the results of a search to
          subscribe to newsgroups. For more information on searching, please take a look at our
          general search help page. The results of the search will be displayed similarly to View
          All Newsgroups above. You can then select or deselect those groups you wish to
          subscribe/unsubscribe to. Please press the "Save Settings" button at the end of
          the page to record changes.<br>
          <br>
          </font>
          <img border="0" src="/drn/images/greendot.gif" width="10" height="9">  
          <strong><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#326698">Personal News
          Settings: </font></strong><font face="Arial" size="2"> You can now set defaults for reading and posting to
          newsgroups with Personal News Settings. The first time you view this page there will
          be no selections. However, once you make any changes and press the "Save
          Settings" button, your current defaults will be loaded on future visits. Changes to
          your settings will take effect immediately and can be changed at any time.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Sort By</b><b>:</b> This option
          let's you select the method for sorting messages within a newsgroup.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefthread.gif" width="70" height="18">
          Sorts newsgroup messages by discussion thread.<br>

          <img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefsubject.gif" width="70" height="18"> Sorts newsgroup messages
          alphabetically by Subject Line.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          <b>             Collapse Binary List:</b> This option will automatically group similar images (gif/jpeg)
          from a posting series, and collapse the entire series into one listing so that similar
          images are better organized within a newsgroup and display area can be conserved.
          As an example, if a person posted 5 different photos of their '68 Ford Mustang, the
          posts would usually appear in a newsgroup like this...</font></p>
          <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefimage1.gif" width="525" height="86"></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">             Rather than take up viewing space within a newsgroup, the "Collapse" feature will only
          display the title/subject line from the first post in an image series, and a secondary
          page will then be created to list all the other related images. These types of posts will
          appear with a "green plus" symbol next to them, as well as a number (5A for this
          example) which represents the number of available images within the posting series...</font></p>
          <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefimage2.gif" width="525" height="21"></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">             If you click on the "green plus" symbol, a secondary page will appear, which lists all
          the individual files that were posted within that series, and from that page the
          individual images can be downloaded or previewed.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>             No Cross Posting:</b> This field determines if you want to automatically cross post to
          the same groups that have been cross posted to in the original message you are
          replying to. If you check the box, your messages will only be posted in the group you
          are in when you respond to a post. If you do not check the box, your message will be
          posted in every group that the original message you are replying to was posted. As an
          example, if you are responding to a message you are viewing in the group
          alt.collecting.stamps.us, and the person who wrote the original message you are
          replying to cross posted the message to rec.collecting.stamps.discuss, if you checked
          the "No Cross Posting" Box, your reply would only appear in the alt.collecting.stamps.us group. It would not appear in the
          rec.collecting.stamps.discuss group that the original poster had cross posted to.
          Similarly, if you did not check the "No Cross Posting" box, your reply would appear in
          both groups just as the original poster's message.<br>
          <br>
             In both cases, you can change the groups any of your messages (either replies to a
          message or a new thread you are creating) are cross-posted to by adding or deleting
          newsgroup names in the "Newsgroup" field of the posting form. If you are posting to
          more than one group, separate the group names by a comma and do not leave any
          blank spaces.<br>
          <br>
          <b>             No X-Archive:</b> When you select this option, your posts will not be stored in archive
          services.<br>
          <br>
          <b>             Author's Name:</b> Please enter your real name or a nickname. Whatever is entered
          here will show as "Author" when you view a list of messages within a newsgroup, and
          will be shown in parentheses following your return address once inside a message. As
          an example, if you were to enter &quot;Fred Smith&quot; in the author name,  the name
          Fred Smith would appear in the author column when viewing a list of messages in a newsgroup as
          follows:</font></p>
          <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefimage3.gif" width="564" height="20"></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Return Address:</b> Please enter your e-mail address in this box. This will be shown on
          the Author line once inside a message. Following the previous example, if
          Fred S were to enter &quot;Fred@email.com&quot; in the Return Address
          field, that information would appear within the messages that he
          posted to the newsgroups.</font></p>
          <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/prefimage4.gif" width="274" height="57"></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please note how the Author name, entered in the previous example as
          &quot;Fred S&quot;, appears in parentheses following the Return Address when viewing an actual message.<br>
          <br>
          <b>             E-Mail Response Address:</b> You can now cc: your posts to an e-mail address. Use
          this field to indicate your reply address on e-mails you send from the newsgroup. This
          address will not be shown in your post.<br>

          <br>
             If you do not specify a maximum number of lines for each part of a multi-part post,
          the service will default to 7500 lines. The range for the number of lines is 1000 -
          15000.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you forget to enter a file name within your subject line for the attachment,
          that information will automatically be inserted for you.. Additionally, if you<br>
             post a file which exceeds the default number of lines (7500) or the number of lines
          you specify in your preferences, your file/post will automatically be
          broken into the correct number of lines and parts.<br>
          <br>
             If, for any reason, your post is not accepted and you get an on-screen
          message telling you to return to the post form to enter missing information, etc., please verify
          the attachment file name is still showing in the Attachment box. If it isn't showing,
          please click the Browse button again and re-select the filename.<br>

          <b>             Organization:</b> You may elect to use the
          &quot;Organization&quot; details currently displayed within this
          settings field, or you may choose to modify it or leave this area

          <b>             Page Length:</b> Enter the number of lines you would like to be displayed on a page.
          Entering 0 (zero) equals infinity. After changing any or all of these settings, do not forget to click the "Save

          <b>             Opening Quote for Post:</b> When you are replying to a post, you can customize the
          introduction of the previous poster's message using this field. Say something witty,
          silly or serious, whatever suits your needs. An example might be "On
          December 21, 1999 I recall say something like..."<br>
