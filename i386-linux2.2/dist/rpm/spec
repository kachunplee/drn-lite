Direct Read News server software provides a powerful, yet easy to use 
multimedia interface for Usenet and other forms of Internet news. Direct 
Read News works in conjunction with virtually any NNTP compliant news 
server software such as INN and bCandid's Typhoon and Breeze. This is a 
fully functional version, and not a trial package.

Direct Read News decodes, assembles and organizes single and multipart 
files, and provides numerous article sort and select options. As an 
example, only a single mouse click is required to decode, assemble, 
download, and/or play large multipart music and video files. All text and 
binary articles are decoded at the server, resulting in 20% reduction in 
download file size and proportionally faster download speeds. In standard 
form, Direct Read News does not require Java, Java Script or ASP functions 
and is therefore compatible with virtually any version of web browser. News 
operators are free to add this function to Direct Read News to meet their 
own site presentation objectives.

Direct Read News is provided complete with full generic menu and help 
systems and is ready to run as downloaded. Installation time is 
approximately 15 minutes for a standard setup. Direct Read News may also be 
heavily customized in layout, appearance, and integration of web functions 
to blend in with existing Internet sites. Modifications may include, but 
are not limited to: page format, fonts and colors, the integration of 
banner programs, icons stylized for the specific service, etc. This may be 
accomplished with all popular web site development tools, and may 
incorporate Java, JavaScript and ASP functionality. For installation
