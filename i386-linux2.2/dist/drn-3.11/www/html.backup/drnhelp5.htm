        articles/messages that have been posted to that group will appear as a list. There a few
        pieces of information which will always appear within an article list, and those items are
        described below:</font><p align="center"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5a.gif" width="565" height="19"></p>

            a newsgroup can be text messages, photos, sound files, videos, etc., and if you look to
            the left of each article you'll find an Action Icon which indicates the type of article
            you are looking at (paper icon = text message, film canister = photo
            or graphic, etc.).
            Besides indicating the type of article or file that has been posted...</font></p>

            action. Direct Read News will automatically decode and display any file oriented post
            (MP3, GIF, MPG, EXE, etc.) in the newsgroups just by clicking on the Action Icon that appears
            next to those articles. As an example, if someone has posted a photo of their car in a
            picture newsgroup, an Image Action Icon (yellow film canister) will appear next to that
            article in the newsgroup. If you click on the icon, Direct Read News will then decode and
            display the photo in your web browser automatically.</font></p>

            article, you would click on this title link.</font></p>

            a single file, which can be automatically downloaded or viewed. All assembled multi-part
            posts will be indicated by one of the &quot;Action Icons&quot; mentioned above, and a
            green &quot;Assembled&quot; checkmark.<br>
            <br>
            When viewing headers in a newsgroup, large multi-part posts can needlessly take up space
            within your viewing area, and will sometimes appear scattered throughout a newsgroup</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">. Aside from this creating a large list of headers to scan
            through, it can often make finding specific posts and parts within a newsgroup cumbersome.<br>
            <br>
            To better organize and display multi-part posts within a newsgroup, the
            &quot;Assembled&quot; feature will only display the Subject line for the first part of a
            &nbsp; multi-part series, rather than display each individual part associated with that
            post. As an example, if a 5 part file were posted to the newsgroups, all 5 parts would
            traditionally be displayed in this manner...<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5h.gif" width="531" height="120"><br>
            <br>
            ...but with the &quot;Assemble&quot; feature, Direct Read News will now display the 5 part
            post as a single assembled file, display an accumulative file size (5 Mb in this example)
            and a green checkmark will be inserted next to that post in the newsgroup...<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5i.gif" width="533" height="55"><br>
            <br>
            If you wanted to download/view the file, you would click on the green checkmark, and if
            you wanted to see how many parts were in the post, you would simply click on the post's
            Subject line (Example: <font color="#0000FF"><u>Our summer vacation video - family.mpg
            (1/5)</u></font>) and Direct Read News will display the individual components of the
            multi-part post.<br>
            </font><br>
            </font>
          </li>
          <li><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5j.gif" width="13" height="15"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">- In the event that a multi part post has not yet been processed,
            it will still be listed with a single Subject line, but a black letter &quot;P&quot; will
            appear next to the post rather than a green checkmark, indicating that it is
            &quot;Unassembled&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            If you wanted to see how many parts had already been processed, you could place your mouse
            cursor over the &quot;Unassembled / P&quot; icon, and a tag will appear indicating the
            number of parts that were available. As an example, if a 5 part post had been made to a
            newsgroup, and 3 of those parts were already processed, the tag would look like this...<br>
            <br>
            </font><img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5k.gif" width="531" height="48"><br>
            <br>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">In the event that your web browser does not support this
            &quot;Alt Tag&quot; function, you can click on the Subject line associated with the
            &quot;Unassembled&quot; post that you were interested in, and DRN will display all the
            parts that have been processed up to that point.<br>
            </font><br>
            </font>

          <li><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5n.gif" width="14" height="12"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">- Often times, you'll run across individual files (images, sounds, etc.), that
            are all different in their own respect, but they were posted as a series, and as a result
            all the images relate to a specific topic or subject matter. As an example, if a person
            posted 5 different photos of their '68 Mustang, the posts would usually appear in a
            newsgroup like this...<br>
            <br>
            </font><img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5l.gif" width="525" height="86"><br>
            <br>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Some postings series can consist of 50 to 100+ unique files,
            which inevitably take up a lot of display space when viewing all the postings within a
            given newsgroup. With that in mind, DRN utilizes a &quot;Collapse&quot; feature that only
            displays the first post within a long posting series to consolidate and save viewing space
            within the newsgroups. These types of posts will appear with a &quot;green plus&quot;
            symbol next to them in a newsgroup, as well as a number (5A for this example) which
            references the number of individual images within a posting series...<br>
            <br>
            <img border="0" src="/drn/images/drnhelp5m.gif" width="525" height="21"><br>
            <br>
            ...and if you click on the &quot;green plus&quot; symbol, it will display a secondary page
            that lists all the individual files that were posted within that series. From that page
            you can then download/preview individual images within the series.</font></font></li>
