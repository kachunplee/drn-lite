1. Limited License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PathLink Technology ("PathLink") grants to you a limited, non-transferable, non-assignable and non-exclusive license ("License") to use these software programs ("Software") solely to access Usenet and Internet news.

PathLink reserves all other rights not expressly granted to you hereunder.

You shall use your best efforts to protect the confidentiality of the Software.  You acknowledge and agree that due to the unique and proprietary nature of the Software, damages may be inadequate to provide PathLink with full compensation in the event of a breach of this Agreement and that PathLink shall therefore be entitled to injunctive relief in the event of any such breach or threatened breach in addition to any other legal remedy that may be available.

2. Taxes.

You agree to pay federal, state, local, and/or other taxes based on this Agreement, the Software or its use, if any, excluding taxes based on PathLink's net income and privilege taxes.

3. Termination.

IN NO EVENT SHALL PATHLINK OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES WERE FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF PATHLINK WAS ADVISED THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE LIKELY OR POSSIBLE.  You acknowledge and agree that the provision of the Software without charge of a fee is reflected in the allocation of risks including, but not limited to, the foregoing limitation of liability.  A modification of the allocation of risks set forth in this Agreement would affect the ability of PATHLINK to offer the Software without charge, and, in consideration of the waiver of charges, you agree to such allocations of risk.
